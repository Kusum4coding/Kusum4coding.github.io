  ## 5th day of student induction program through my eyes
  This day was so wonderful ...as our collage campus is so big .our department visit was conducted i enjoyed it it very much .In morning first we all gathered outside the MBA block.then we went to a lab in which Dr.Amit kamra addressed us . They asked us to answer 4 question the questions was:-
                            Q1:-What is your short term goal?
                            Q2:-What is your long-term goal?
                            Q3:-How do you got to know GNDEC?
                            Q4:- Difference between CS and IT? 
 IN my opinion answer of these 4 questions are:-
                             A1:-To make good understanding with my teachers,senoirs and to work upon basic MS excel skills.
                             A2:-To become successful in the feild of IT and to become a good codder
                             A3:-From Respected Shaffy mamwho is my 10th class science teacher .they guided me to take Non- MEDICAL on the basis of my interest and score in Science and intoduced btech to me
