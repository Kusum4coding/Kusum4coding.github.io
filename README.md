## 6th day for me
Our First lecture was of UHV in that we learned about the chapter "Understanding the human being as Co exixtence of self and body "in that we came to know that self is concious entity , requirements of self  are continous,requirements of self  are:-glory,love,respect these are to acheive the state of happiness.requrements of self are qualitative on the other hand ,body is material entity,requirements of body are discontinous, reqirements of body are physical facilites,requirements of body are quantitative.Desire is a mental image of either materil or relationship fullfilment.thought is image to fulfil desire.expectation is choosing of thought accordind to our taste.desire based upon three factors:-pre conditioning,sensation,natural acceptance.If imagination is based on desire,pre-conditioning then it is enslaved.if self is in disharmony then body will also go in disharmony and if body is in disharmony then self will also go in disharmony. we also leaned about relationship,relationship is always between oneself and otherself to have right understanding upon relationshipwe have to know feelings deeply .list of feelings


1. Trust
2. Respect
3. Affection
4. Care
5. Guidance
6. Reverence
